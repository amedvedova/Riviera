# Riviera

Code to convert the raw legacy data from the 1999 MAP-Riviera field campaign into .nc format which is easily usable for further analysis.

Since two different labs (ETH and MCR) took part in the field campaign and each collected and analyzed their own data, the code for data processing is also divided into two folders, one per each lab. Detailed documentation about the data processing can be found in the documentation folder, together with some more useful information.
